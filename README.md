## tinyproxy Description

Tinyproxy is a light-weight HTTP/HTTPS proxy daemon for POSIX  
operating systems. Designed from the ground up to be fast and yet  
small, it is an ideal solution for use cases such as embedded  
deployments where a full featured HTTP proxy is required, but the  
system resources for a larger proxy are unavailable.  


## Motivation

Tinyproxy is a very useful software for HTTP Proxy, but seems that it's not being built recently in EL8 platforms, I'm backporting it from OpenSUSE (C).
